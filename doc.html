      Your design process: How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs / ideas you attempted in the beginning?
      Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?
      Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Understanding the Data</h4>
        <p>Before diving into visualization design, I thoroughly analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and relationships. This involved examining variables such as Happiness, Fertility, GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, and others to identify potential patterns and correlations.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Identifying Goals and Audience</h4>
        <p>I clarified the primary goal of the visualization, which was to explore trends among different continents/countries based on various factors and their relationship to happiness. Additionally, I considered the intended audience, which in this case could be individuals interested in global development, policymakers, or researchers.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Choosing Visual Encoding</h4>
        <p>I selected appropriate visual encodings for the variables based on their nature and the insights I aimed to convey. For example, I used scatter plots to visualize the relationship between Happiness and other factors like Fertility or GDP per Capita. Color was employed to encode the continent variable, making it easier to distinguish data points from different regions.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Layout and Interaction</h4>
        <p>I designed the layout to facilitate comparison and exploration. Placing the axes and dropdown menus prominently ensured ease of use and allowed users to interactively select variables of interest. Tooltips were incorporated to provide additional information on data points, enhancing interactivity and comprehension.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Iterative Design Process</h4>
        <p>Throughout the design process, I iterated on different layouts, color schemes, and interaction mechanisms to optimize clarity and effectiveness. Feedback from users or stakeholders was valuable in refining the visualization and addressing potential usability issues.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Rationale for Design Choices</h4>
        <p>Each design choice was made deliberately to enhance the understanding and exploration of the data. For example, using color to encode continents enabled users to quickly identify geographic patterns, while interactive features like dropdown menus empowered users to customize their exploration based on their interests.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Discovery and Validation</h4>
        <p>Finally, I used the visualization to explore trends and relationships among variables. By analyzing the data visually and interacting with the visualization, I was able to discover insights such as the correlation between happiness and factors like GDP per Capita or Life Expectancy across different continents. </p>
